# Personal Website — Md. Lutfur Rahman (starter)

This is a minimal single-page site for an Editor & Actor.

How to review locally:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no build step required).

What to replace:
- index.html: update the name, headline, bio, credits, showreel iframe src, and contact email.
- Add your resume as `resume.pdf` in the repo root if you want the Download Resume button to work.
- Replace placeholder social links with real links.

Publishing:
- You can publish via GitHub Pages from the repository settings (select branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`).
